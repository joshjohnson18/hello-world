I am in my third year at EWU, my name is Josh Johnson and I love sports. My favorite teams are the Eastern Eagles, Seattle Seahawks, Seattle Sounders, and the Seattle Mariners. I am from Renton, Washington and I have two older brothers and a younger brother. I played soccer for 16 years, football for 6 years, and was on the swim team for 13 years.
